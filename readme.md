Description:
  - The Music Buster app uses two APIs (TheAudioDB and lyrics.ovh) to obtain all kinds of cool information regarding an artist,
    including their discography, social media links, most loved tracks, music video links, etc. The default page displays a current
    trending list of albums and songs, but these information will be hidden once the user searches for a valid artist name. The search
    parameter has to rely on a valid artist name (even if the album/song search parameters have inputs) otherwise no new information
    will be displayed. The album and song search parameters contain information that are similar to each other and the display artist
    container, except the main difference is that there would be a lyrics section in the display song container. In addition, there is a     mic-speak function that allows the user to search through Google by saying whatever the user says. Also, there is a clickable
    feedback-icon in the footer that opens up the user's default mail (according to their mail settings), and displays an email form to
    send to one of the app developers. The Music Buster app is also mobile responsive, so it looks neat in small screen sizes.

  - The Music Buster app and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes
    Bulma Framework with its various components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices and media queries (to change
    the look of the Music Buster app on mobile screens). The javascript file contains variables (const/let), functions, onclick events,     for-loops, and if-else statements for the logic behind the search parameters, buttons/modals, and the artist/album/song display
    containers (dynamically added to the page).

  Challenges:
  - Overall, the team is very satisfied with the app because it looks all clean and nice, and the functions work as they are intended.
    This is definitely a worthy experience to have because it simulates a real-life working collaboration environment, and that all our
    hard work and efforts was certainly not wasted!
  - Initially, this project wasn't really hard to brainstorm and come up with ideas on what kind of app to develop. Once we decided on
    something music related, then our team had to go through several APIs, so we could find the suitable ones, and then we had to read
    their documentation. Thankfully, theAudioDB API had pretty much all the information that we needed, so other APIs that we searched
    up was either scrapped or would've been implemented as an additional feature. The Bulma Framework was a bit challenging to start on,
    since it took about a full day or 2 for the team to get comfortable on it, since we're used to Bootstrap documentation. In the CSS,
    the main issue was media queries because some elements just didn't look very good on smaller screens (mic speech input form and 
    the mic image), but other than that, the CSS went well. Surprisingly, the Javascript code went a lot smoother than expected, mainly
    because we were able to find solutions online (Stack Overflow) and we had the help from the TAs and the instructor. There were two
    main issues in the Javascript: one was the dynamically added track info modals for the most loved tracks section, and the other was
    the embedded Youtube music videos. The former was solved through the help of the instructor, whereas the latter was instead replaced
    with URL links. 
  - The members in the team definitely learned a lot, but it varies to each person in regards to what they learned and how they were 
    able to solve each problem. Overall, this project helped us improve our skills as incoming web developers, and we also got to learn
    the Bulma Framework, which is great!
  - We were all able to solve every problem through good communication, continuous effort, patience, time management, online resources,
    and help from the TAs/Instructor!
